grunt-asset-bender
==================

A series of grunt tasks to help integrate asset bender pre-compilation, versioning, etc into a grunt workflow.

Note, this currently depends on the HSStatic module which isn't avaiable
publically yet. We'll get to it in the future, but just let me know if
that blocks anyone (we can copy out the two or three functions it relies
on)
